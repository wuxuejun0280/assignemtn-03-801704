# Assignment Assignment_03_801704

The code is in the code folder. The clientstreamuploadapp is modified from the project in assignment2. Please change the path to the correlated csv file before running the app. 
The streamanalytic is a flink app which runs with local environment. The test is all done with local environment instead on a real flink platform. So just run the TaxiStreamAnalytic file is fine. 

The data folder contains information about the data and a demo of the taxi data. 

All the report in in the assignment-03-design file in report document. 

Since the test is by the throughput of rabbitmq, there is not any log file.
